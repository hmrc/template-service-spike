## Hereâ€™s the extensive documentation for the API:

### Environment requirements:

* [WGET](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm) >= 1.19.1
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10.15.1

### 1.

`POST` to `/govuk/$$VERSION$$/components/$$COMPONENT_NAME$$` where `$$COMPONENT_NAME$$` is the name of the component from govuk-frontend (e.g. `govukSelect`, `govukButton`, `govukHeader`) and `$$VERSION$$` is the NPM package version (e.g. `3.0.0`, `3.1.0`), this must be 3.0.0 or greater.

The request body should contain JSON (therefore a `content-type: application/json` on the request) containing the parameters for the component.  For example:

Posting to `/govuk/3.3.0/components/govukButton` with a body of `{"text": "Save and continue"}` would return the HTML:

```
<button class="govuk-button" data-module="govuk-button">
  Save and continue
</button>
```

### 2.

`GET` from `/examples-output/$$COMPONENT_NAME$$` where `$$COMPONENT_NAME$$` is the name of the component from govuk-frontend e.g. `govukSelect`, `govukButton`, `govukHeader`

The response will contain the Nunjucks and HTML output of each available example for that component.

The response structure is as follows:

`
  [
    {
      html: '<div>some markup</div>',
      name: '<component_id>/<example_id>',
      nunjucks: '{% some Nunjucks %}'
    }
  ]
`
